### Game Logic:
+ Setup: Each player gets a grid and a fleet of ships of various sizes (e.g., battleship, destroyer, submarine). Players secretly arrange their ships on their grid without the other player seeing.
+ Gameplay: Players take turns calling out shots at coordinates on the opponent's grid (e.g., "D5"). If a shot hits a ship, the opponent marks it as a hit. If it misses, the opponent marks it as a miss. The game continues with players calling shots and trying to guess the location and orientation of their opponent's ships.
+ Winning: The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game. Players call out "You sank my battleship!" when one of their larger ships is destroyed.
