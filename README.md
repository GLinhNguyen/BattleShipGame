### Game Logic:
+ Setup: Each player gets a grid and a fleet of ships of various sizes (e.g., battleship, destroyer, submarine). Players secretly arrange their ships on their grid without the other player seeing.
+ Gameplay: Players take turns click to the cell that they want to shoot. If a shot hits a ship, the opponent marks it as a hit. If it misses, the opponent marks it as a miss. The game continues with players placing shots and trying to guess the location and orientation of their opponent's ships.
+ Winning: The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game. Players will see a message such as "You win!" or "You lost!" depends on who win :smiley:  .
